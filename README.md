# Modern-Portfolio
Hello! This is the code for my personal portfolio. 
It uses several public JS libraries and open-source code 
that I chose to implement within my portfolio for added
functionality and better design. If you want to build and 
run the code on your local machine, simply clone the code, 
and in the top level directory, run npm install then npm run dev and
it should open in http://localhost:3000/.
